# Time Warp
## High Concept
An avoidance game in which time slows when the player is near hazards. Players must survive to earn points. Both the player and hazards speed up over the course of the game to the point of ludicrous speed.
## Genre
Arcade Avoidance
## Platform
Desktop Only
## Story
This game is mostly abstract and contains no story or theme. You play as a spaceship in an asteroid field. The mood consists of excitement and high speed thrills. The player is motivated to survive for as long as possible to earn a higher score.
## Aesthetics
### Graphical Style
The graphical style is abstract and psychedelic. The visuals become more intense and ramp up in intensity the longer the game goes on.
### Music
The music style will be techno and also become more intense the longer the game goes on.
### Sound Effects
The game will consist of the sound effects for the different hazards including lasers, spikes, bullets, and asteroids. There will also be sound effects for the slowing of time.
## Gameplay
### Mechanics
One core mechanic is that time slows down when the player gets near hazards and that time speeds up the longer the game goes on. The player can also only move in bursts towards their facing direction. The bursts charge up over time to give a greater burst of speed.
### Control
The player uses the mouse to determine the direction to move and the left mouse button to charge up the burst of speed.
### Teaching the Game
The controls are on the main screen before the player starts playing. The hazards and mechanics are taught through experimentation.
### Player Learning
The player must learn how to control their ship and navigate the asteroid field. Players must learn when and how long to charge up the ship's engines.

## Stretch Goals
The win condition could be changed to hitting light speed to "warp through time" instead of just being a score attack game. The game could also consist of premade levels that the player progresses through. Powerups could be implemented that the player can pick up. They could grant bonuses like a temporary shield or finer control of the ship.
