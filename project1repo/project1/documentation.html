        <h2>Process</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
            I began work on the overall layout and color scheme. Once I decided on that, I began working on the navigation system and header. I spent the most time on this part of the project. I then got the header and navigation to respond to different screen sizes. I then moved onto formating the content of each page before adding some images.
            </p>

        <h2>Resources Used</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
            I mainly used W3Schools to help with difficult css and html concepts such as flexbox. I used colourlovers and Paletton for help with the color scheme. I also just googled any other problems I encountered and found results on numerous forums.

            The home or "landing" page has a description of the project and game. I also feel it grabs the user's attention.
            </li>
            <li>
            The proposal page contains a treatment of the game and includes almost all of the points on the template. It contains two images and is marked up heavily.

            <li>
            This documentation page documents my progress and includes the resources I used and what sources my assests came from.

            <li>
            The project page includes a placeholder for the game.

            <li>
            Tags such as main, header, navigation, aside, and section are used apporpriately.

            <li>
            There are more than 5 style declarations and more than 1 class and id selectors used. All links are styled.
