            Your ship is hurtleing through an asteroid and to make matters worse your engine is on the fritz. Time Warp is a game about rocketing through space at high speed where you must dodge both asteroids and laser fire. Your only aid comes from the warping and slowing down of time around dangerous hazards. The longer you survive the higher your score will be, but the faster you and other hazards will move, too.

            This website is a project proposal and game treatment for my game Time Warp. This was made as a class project for IGME-230.
